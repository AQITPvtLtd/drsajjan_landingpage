            data: `<p> Although cancer is common, only 5-10% of it is hereditary, which means someone has inherited a higher risk for cancer from a parent. The risk of cancer can be inherited through a small change (called a mutation) in a gene that can be passed from one generation to the next. Cancer is a hereditary disease, meaning that inherited gene mutations account for about 5 to 10% of all cases. If there has been more than one generation of cancer, it might be considered hereditary. A family history means that one or more of your blood relatives has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. These relatives may be deceased or still living. It may be parents, siblings, or children of first-degree relatives. Most cancer patients do not have a family history of the disease. It is estimated that about 5% to 10% of cancer cases can be inherited. Myth: If my family has cancer, I will get it too. The fact is, there are times when members of the same family develop cancer due to shared behaviors.</p>
           <p> It is impossible for cancer genes to skip generations. One in two (50%) chances are that you have inherited a gene mutation from your parents. In other words, whether you have it or not. It is impossible for you to pass the mutation on to your children if you do not inherit it. Therefore, some children will carry the faulty gene and be at increased risk of developing cancer, while others will not.</p>`,

                <p>The choice of treatment depends on the type of cancer, presentation stage, age, patient's general condition, pathology, and molecular reports. All these factors are taken into consideration before making a treatment decision. Many cancers require multi-modality treatments e.g. surgery followed by chemo or radiotherapy, concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, chemo-immunotherapy, etc. Consultations with a surgical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist are required in such scenarios.</p>
